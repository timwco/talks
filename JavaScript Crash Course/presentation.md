## Data Types

Other than `objects`, we have the following primitives:

* __**Number**__ - `1` or `500` or `3.14`
* __**String**__ - `"Any Message in Quotes"`
* __**Boolean**__ - `true` or `false`
* __**Null**__ - is an empty value: `null`
* __**Undefined**__ - is the absence of a value: `undefined`

##  Variables

Declare a variable

```javascript
var firstName;
```

Assign a value to a variable

```javascript
firstName = 'Tim';
```

Shorthand (Declare and assign)

```javascript
var firstName = 'Tim';
```

---

## Variables (Rules)

- Begin with letters, $ or _
- Only contain letters, numbers, $ and _
- Case sensitive
- No reserved words - [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#Keywords)

---

## Variables (Conventions)

- camelCase vs snake_case
- Choose and stick with a convention

## Expressions


> Variables can store the result of an expression

```javascript
var age = 2016 - 1983;
var greeting = "My name is Tim and I am " + age + " years old";
var isOld = age > 100;
```

---

## Comments

var firstName = "Tim"; // Single Line Comment

/*
  Multi Line
  Comment (Comment Block)
*/
var a = 1;
var b = 2;
var c = 1 + 2;
```

  return “Hello, “ + name + “!”;

}

greet(“Tim”); // Hello, Tim!
```
